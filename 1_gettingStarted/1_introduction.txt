React is platform independent. Its actually React Dom library that adds the web support. Similarly, its React Native that adds the app support!
Its only the Jsx code that gets compiled, not the javascript logic.
We'll be using Expo as its much easier to build react native apps using Expo.
Install Node.js
Use 'npx create-expo-app' to create a new app.
Run 'npm start' to start your app. 
Install Expo go on your device and scan the QR code.
