There is no css in React Native. Instead there are inline styles and StyleSheet Objects.
App.js is the root component and its the first point of contact for the expo.
There are some basic components (ex. the html elements like div and h1 etc.) that we use here. We have to import every component that we use.
we use the style prop and pass a js object in it to do the styling.
Flexbox is enabled for the View component by default and the direction set by-default is column. 
The flex property is applied to the items that are inside of the flexbox.
Styles dont cascade in native. for eg. if we set color: 'white' to a parent element <view> in <View><Text></Text></View>, this has no effect on the Text component, unlike in css.
<ScrollView> is used when there are few or limited number of list items because it renders each and every list item, even when its not visible to the user, therefore leading to performance issues. So, in such cases when the list is dynamic, or has many items in it, we use a <FlatList> component.
